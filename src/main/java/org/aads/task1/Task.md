**Sequence**

1. Grammar of the correct bracket sequence.
   A proper bracket sequence is a sequence consisting of characters - "brackets", in which each opening bracket corresponds to a closing bracket of the same type as the opening bracket. For example, the following sequences are correct: [([])((([[]]])))]{()}, ()((()))[[]]. The bracket sequences [[)) will not be correct (the type of closing brackets does not match the type of opening ones), }{ (the closing bracket comes before the opening one), [[{{}}] (not every opening bracket corresponds to the closing one).
